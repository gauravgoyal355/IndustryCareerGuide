### 6. Finance/Economics PhD (Mathematical Domain)
**Expected:** Quantitative Analyst, Financial Analyst, VC Analyst, Data Scientist
**Actual Top 3:** Business Development Manager (60%), VC Analyst (59%), Quantitative Analyst (52%)
**Accuracy:** 66.7% (2/3 expected matches found)

**Moderate Success:**
- Two expected matches in top 3
- Financial background being recognized
- Business roles appropriately weighted

## Algorithm Issues Identified

### 1. Skill Weighting Problems
- **Creative skills undervalued**: Design/creative careers scoring poorly despite high creativity ratings
- **Technical skills not prioritized**: Programming/quantitative skills not driving matches to technical roles
- **Writing skills inconsistent**: Technical writing careers missing from research-oriented profiles

### 2. Domain Expertise Bonuses
- **Mathematical domain**: 25% bonus insufficient for technical role prioritization
- **Life sciences domain**: Pushing toward policy rather than core biotech/healthcare roles
- **Social sciences domain**: Working well for business roles

### 3. Career Taxonomy Issues
- **Intellectual Property Analyst**: Scoring unrealistically high across multiple profiles
- **Policy careers**: Over-represented in life sciences matches
- **Core technical roles**: Data Science, AI/ML scoring lower than expected

### 4. Knockout Rules Effectiveness
- Prerequisites being met but not driving appropriate rankings
- Clinical experience requirements not properly filtering healthcare roles
- Programming requirements not elevating software/data science roles

## Radar Chart Analysis

The radar chart dimensions are well-designed but the underlying scoring doesn't translate effectively:

**Well-Functioning Dimensions:**
- Independence vs. Collaboration balance
- Risk Tolerance assessment
- Communication skills evaluation

**Problematic Dimensions:**
- Technical Skills not correlating with technical career matches
- Creativity not driving creative career matches
- Analytical Thinking too broadly applied

## Recommendations for Algorithm Improvement

### 1. Immediate Fixes (High Priority)

**Adjust Category Weights:**
```javascript
// Current weights seem insufficient for technical roles
data_analytics: { skills: 0.8, values: 0.15, temperament: 0.05 }
technology_engineering: { skills: 0.8, values: 0.15, temperament: 0.05 }
```

**Fix Intellectual Property Analyst Scoring:**
- Review skill requirements - currently too broad
- Add more specific prerequisites (patent experience, legal background)
- Reduce complexity multipliers that inflate scores

**Enhance Domain Bonuses:**
```javascript
// Increase domain bonuses for technical fields
mathematical: { bonus_multiplier: 1.4 }, // Was 1.25
engineering: { bonus_multiplier: 1.4 }   // Was 1.25
```

### 2. Medium-Term Improvements

**Creative Career Calibration:**
- Increase creative skill complexity multipliers
- Add specific creative prerequisites (portfolio, design experience)
- Enhance creative_design_experience weighting

**Healthcare Role Refinement:**
- Strengthen clinical experience requirements
- Reduce policy career dominance for life sciences PhDs
- Add medical knowledge prerequisites

**Technical Writing Enhancement:**
- Add writing-specific skills to research profiles
- Create technical communication skill category
- Improve scientific writing career definitions

### 3. Long-Term Enhancements

**Skill Clustering:**
- Group related skills for better matching
- Create skill hierarchies (basic → advanced technical skills)
- Implement progressive skill requirements

**Dynamic Weighting:**
- Adjust weights based on user's strongest skill areas
- Implement adaptive algorithms based on profile strength
- Add confidence scoring to matches

**User Experience Improvements:**
- Provide detailed match explanations
- Show skill gap analysis for aspirational careers
- Add career progression pathways

## Testing Recommendations

### Regular Testing Protocol
1. **Monthly accuracy testing** with diverse PhD profiles
2. **A/B testing** of algorithm parameter changes
3. **User feedback integration** from actual quiz takers
4. **Edge case testing** for interdisciplinary PhDs

### Validation Metrics
- **Match accuracy**: Target >75% for top 3 matches
- **User satisfaction**: Track user ratings of suggested careers
- **Conversion tracking**: Monitor application rates for suggested roles
- **Diversity metrics**: Ensure algorithm works across all PhD domains

## Conclusion

The career matching algorithm shows strong potential, particularly for business-oriented profiles. However, significant improvements are needed for technical, creative, and research-focused PhDs. The core architecture is sound, but skill weighting, domain bonuses, and career taxonomy need substantial calibration.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Fix Intellectual Property Analyst over-scoring immediately
2. Increase technical skill weighting for data science/engineering roles  
3. Enhance creative skill recognition for design careers
4. Strengthen clinical experience weighting for healthcare roles
5. Implement regular testing protocol for continuous improvement

With these improvements, the algorithm can achieve the target 75%+ accuracy across all PhD archetypes and provide truly valuable career guidance for the PhD-to-industry transition.
